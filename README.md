# Student Organizer Facilitation Training

In the distant mists of 2008–2011, I was involved in student (and recent alumni) organizing. My generation of activists adopted a method of meeting facilitation and participation I have often wished was better known and more widely used. I’ve tried to codify what I can remember below. Please let me know if your recollection differs or if you find any mistakes.

## Meetings, am I right?

A meeting is a success if it accomplishes these four things:

- Gives everyone involved a more complete understanding of the problem being discussed and the solutions available
- Fosters meaningful and productive deliberation
- Results in a clear decision with concrete next actions
- Minimizes pain

Your meetings probably don’t accomplish these things, which is why you’re reading this. Let’s do better.

## How are we going to do this?

1. Agenda—have a plan
2. Roles—who is responsible for what
3. Discussion—understand what’s going on
4. Consensus—decide what to do
5. Follow-up—make sure it gets done

## Agenda & Roles

### Agenda

This is the most important part of the meeting: a written list of everything you plan to address at this meeting. Go through the agenda at the beginning of the meeting so everyone has a chance to add items that have become worthy of discussion since the agenda was written. Here’s a template you can steal:

- Introductory go-around (only skip this if every person at the meeting knows everyone else)
- Old business
	- Reportbacks on ongoing work
		- Keep ’em short
	- You may schedule other forms of follow-up here as well; for example, if a discussion leading to a major decision becomes acrimonious and divisive, the facilitator may recommend delaying further discussion to the next meeting, in which case it would happen during old business 
- New business
	- This is where you talk about new issues that affect the whole group
	- If a working group wants to embark in a new, possibly-controversial direction, they talk about it here
	- Votes usually take place here
- Note taker reviews decisions and commitments to do work
- Pick facilitator and any other roles for next meeting
	- You may also want to go over the planned agenda for the next meeting here

### Roles

Don’t have the same people fill these roles at every meeting. 

- Facilitator
	- Every meeting has a facilitator
	- The facilitator starts the meeting, moves through items on the agenda, guides the discussion toward points of consensus, takes votes on important questions, and ultimately calls the meeting adjourned
	- If the facilitator doesn't want you to speak, you don't speak
	- The facilitator can take on the responsibilities of the note-taker and stack-taker at smaller meetings
- Note-taker
	- Most meetings have a note-taker
	- The note-taker takes notes and emails them to all meeting attendees
	- It is really hard to participate actively while taking notes, so make sure the same people aren’t stuck taking notes every time
- Stack-taker
	- Only big or contentious meetings need a dedicated stack-taker
	- The stack-taker keeps track of who has raised their hand and in what order, prioritizing people who don’t usually get to participate in the discussion

## Discussion & Consensus

### Discussion

Here are useful methods the facilitator and stack-taker can use to foster discussion.

#### Go-Around

The facilitator announces she is doing a go-around and then, perhaps starting with herself, points to each person in turn and has them give an opinion or comment on the topic at hand. Usually, a number of people in the group will have something to say, if for no other reason than to agree or disagree with what someone before them said. If someone doesn’t have anything to say, they can pass.

Go-arounds can work very well on conference calls, with the modification that the facilitator calls out the name of each person before their turn. They don't work as well in very large groups

#### Stack

The facilitator tells the group she is taking stack and that when someone wants to speak, they should raise their hand. When the stack-taker sees a hand go up, she should make eye contact and give that person a nod; that’s their signal that they’re on stack and can lower their hand. Meanwhile, the stack taker notes who raised their hands and in what order.

A note to the stack-taker: just because they raised their hands in a certain order doesn’t mean you have to call on them in that order. You have a responsibility to ensure that *all* voices are heard, not just the voices of the few who talk most often. If a small number of participants have been dominating the meeting (and especially if those same participants have a history of dominating meetings), you can and should move them lower on the stack, prioritizing people who rarely speak. Announce that you’re doing this: when one person has finished speaking, say, “Amir, Fatima, and Sarah are on stack; I am prioritizing Fatima because she hasn’t spoken today.” This benefits both the less frequent talkers, who don’t end up excluded or marginalized, and the more frequent talkers, who can offer their contributions without worrying about crowding out everyone else.

You should consider using weighted stack. This is just like normal stack, but in addition to prioritizing people who speak less often, you prioritize groups that get fewer opportunities to speak in day to day life. In the US, that usually means women, people of color, LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer), and working class folks.

#### Popcorn

The facilitator suggests that everyone popcorn, and people offer whatever comes to mind as it comes to mind. Popcorning can be great for small meetings and terrible for large meetings.

#### Call-Ons

There are times when you know an individual has some particular piece of information relevant to the current conversation. For example, someone may have made a proposal to take an action or create a working group, and others have brought up questions or concerns. You as facilitator can call on the original proposal-maker to address or respond to the group’s concerns. Another common situation is where discussion is focused on a topic in which you know a member of the group has extensive experience. You can call on that member to share their knowledge or offer an opinion.

### Consensus

As the discussion proceeds, the facilitator should help the group address concerns, find points of agreement and coalesce around a plan of action. 

#### Offer Summaries & Ask Questions

The facilitator can propose a summary of someone’s position or ask a question to clarify their position. When proposing a summary, always offer the person being summarized the opportunity to amend or reject the summary.

#### Take Temperature

The facilitator can take the temperature of the group on an issue to see if more discussion is necessary. For example, if someone has just proposed a course of action, and the group seems amenable, the facilitator might ask for an informal show of thumbs (see voting, below) to see whether consensus already exists or if there are strong objections that need to be addressed.

#### Thumb voting

The facilitator articulates a decision that must be made (to pursue a particular course of action, to abandon discussion of a topic, etc.) and everyone votes by show of thumbs:

- Thumb up—I support this decision
- Thumb sideways—I am neutral or have reservations about this decision
- Thumb down—I block this decision. If my objection is ignored, I would rather leave the group permanently than go along with the decision

If everyone votes thumbs up, record the vote in the minutes and move on. If anyone votes thumb sideways or down, the facilitator should give them an opportunity to express their reservation or neutrality. Sometimes a small change to the proposal can convert a bunch of thumbs sideways or down to thumbs up.

It’s fine for a vote to pass with a number of thumbs sideways, as long as those folks have expressed their reservations and real efforts have been made to adjust the proposal. If half the group is neutral or has reservations on a proposal, though, that’s a sign that there isn’t a lot of energy or commitment behind it, and the facilitator should consider voting thumb down to block.

If there is even a single thumb down, that’s a block and the vote cannot pass unless everyone is prepared for that person to leave the group permanently. The blocker should be given every opportunity to express their reservation and suggest modifications to the proposal.

Note: this isn't parliament and the goal isn't a definitive vote to bind you forever and ever, amen. Help your group arrive at an informed consensus. If that means retaking a vote because someone misheard the proposal or wasn't paying attention, so be it. 

### Methods for other participants

#### Twinkle fingers

Did someone just say something really smart, insightful, or otherwise praiseworthy? Twinkle your fingers to show your support. This avoids disrupting a meeting with cheers and "I agree!" while obviating the need to get on stack to express their agreement. 

#### Direct response

Direct response is a way to interject with a short and timely piece of information directly related to what the current speaker just said. An ideal use of direct response would be if the current speaker just encouraged everyone to attend the rally on Wednesday—__direct response, the rally is on Tuesday!__ With a direct response, you interrupt the person speaking, bypass the facilitator, and skip ahead of everyone waiting in stack. So only use it when the interruption will be brief, important, and time-critical.

Direct response should __never, ever__ be used for giving your opinion. Did someone just say something you disagree with? Get on stack. Did the facilitator move you down stack to prioritize someone else? Trust his or her judgment. Do not abuse a valuable tool like direct response just because your feelings were hurt.

#### Point of process

Unclear on the terms of a vote? Believe the facilitator missed a block on a vote? Have another concern about the facilitation? Make a triangle with your hands and hold it over your head. You've just raised a point of process, and the facilitator should immediately halt the discussion to address the issue. 

This is a powerful tool. If you use point of process to grind an axe, expect everyone to hate you. If you use point of process to sea lion the facilitator, you deserve what's coming to you. 

## Notes & follow up

There's limited use in having a discussion and reaching a consensus if no one remembers what was discussed or takes the actions agreed upon by consensus. 

### Notes

If the agenda is the most important ingredient of a good meeting (and it is), notes are the second-most important. They have two roles:

1. Formalize decisions made during the meeting
2. Remind everyone what those decisions were

Someone has to take notes at every meeting. Usually it's best to have a separate note taker, because it is difficult to facilitate while constantly stopping to jot down notes. The note taker's goal is to capture every decision made at the meeting, every action any individual agrees to take, and the general shape of the discussion, then distribute the notes to the group as quickly as possible. Actually, it's a good idea to end your meetings by having the note taker read back all the consensus decisions and all the actions individuals agreed to take before the meeting is adjourned. Once the meeting is adjourned, the note taker emails the notes to the group. 

Most note takers take their notes directly into an email program to make distributing the notes quick and easy, but variations are possible. For a conference call, it can be nice to throw a link to a blank Google doc in the agenda, distribute the agenda prior to the call, then take notes there. That way, call participants can follow along in the notes while the call is in progress. 

### Follow up

The facilitator (either this meeting's or next meeting's, but usually next meeting's) should refer to the notes when putting together next week's agenda. Did someone agree to do something? Follow up on the agenda. 

If your group is engaged in complex work over long periods of time, you may want to request that someone volunteer as a bottom liner at the end of each week. The bottom liner gets in touch with the people or groups who offered to do work, reminds them of the work, and records their progress on a chart, which is then used as a point of reference at the next meeting. There are all sorts of interesting ways bottom lining and working groups can interact, but that's getting more into organizational structure than facilitation. 

## The end

Your turn.
